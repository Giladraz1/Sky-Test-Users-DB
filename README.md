# Sky User Test DB

User directory App: this time, using MongoDB and Node.js-based full-stack web application. It
leverages technologies like MongoDB for data storage, Node.js for the server-side implementation, and
Mongoose as an object modeling tool for MongoDB. The frontend is built using Angular and
communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs. Users can perform CRUD operations on a collection
of entries, managing data.

RUN `npm install`

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Backend server

Open a new terminal, and run `npm run mongo`
